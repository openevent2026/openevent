# OpenEvent

[中文版](README_cn.md)

OpenEvent is a gRPC-based event channel service for applications that need a
globally ordered event stream and channel-level access control.

The server provides message publishing, historical fetch, live subscription,
channel management, and token management APIs. The shared Protocol Buffers
schema and SDK documentation live in the `openevent-sdk` submodule.

## Features

- Globally ordered messages based on `seq`.
- Supports both client-assigned `seq` publishing and server-assigned `seq`.
- Channels support `public`, `protected`, and `private` visibility.
- Supports batch fetch and server-streaming subscription.
- Token-based authentication for business requests.
- Includes a Python SDK submodule.

## Build

Install the build dependencies for your Linux distribution first:

- CMake 3.20+
- C++20 compiler
- Protobuf and `protoc`
- gRPC and `grpc_cpp_plugin`
- RocksDB
- yaml-cpp

Initialize submodules:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Configure a build directory:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
```

Build:

```bash
cmake --build build -j2
```

Run tests:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The server binary is generated at:

```text
build/openevent_server
```

Common CMake options:

- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug|Release`
- `BUILD_TESTING=ON|OFF`
- `CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR=bin|sbin|...`

## Install

Build and install are separate steps. `cmake --build` compiles the project and
generates artifacts under the build directory; `cmake --install` copies those
artifacts to an installation prefix.

Install to a specific prefix:

```bash
cmake --install build --prefix /opt/openevent
```

The default installed executable path is:

```text
/opt/openevent/bin/openevent_server
```

To change the executable subdirectory, pass `CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR` during
configuration:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR=sbin
cmake --build build -j2
cmake --install build --prefix /opt/openevent
```

The executable is then installed at:

```text
/opt/openevent/sbin/openevent_server
```

`cmake --install build` usually does not rebuild source files automatically, so
run the build step before installing.

## Configuration

The server must be started with a valid YAML configuration file path. The server
rejects startup if the path is missing, does not exist, or is not a regular file.

See [Configuration](docs/CONFIG.md) for configuration examples, field
definitions, and deployment notes.

## Run

Run from the source build directory:

```bash
build/openevent_server /path/to/openevent-server.yaml
```

Run an installed binary:

```bash
/opt/openevent/bin/openevent_server /path/to/openevent-server.yaml
```

If `CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR` was set to `sbin`, adjust the path accordingly:

```bash
/opt/openevent/sbin/openevent_server /path/to/openevent-server.yaml
```

## Deployment

Use the installed executable in deployments, and pass a deployment-specific
configuration file. See [Configuration](docs/CONFIG.md) for config file
placement, data directory permissions, and admin port security requirements.

## SDK

See the [openevent-sdk](https://github.com/openevent-official/openevent-sdk)
repository for SDK build, installation, and test instructions.

## Open Source Publishing Notes

- The SDK submodule points to
  `https://github.com/openevent-official/openevent-sdk.git`.
- Confirm the copyright holder in [LICENSE](LICENSE).
- Enable private vulnerability reporting in GitHub if the repository is public.

## Project Status

OpenEvent is still in an early stage. Public API behavior is defined by the
[SDK API contract](https://github.com/openevent-official/openevent-sdk/blob/main/docs/API.md);
clients should rely on the documented gRPC contract, not server implementation
details.
